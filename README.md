# 4KReleaseChecker
![4KReleaseChecker](4KReleaseCheckerScreenshot.jpg)  
  
Checks your Plex library for 1080p releases that have a 4K version available.  
Requires a [TMDB API Key](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started).  
You can find your Plex Token by following [this guide](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).  
You can find your Plex Server URL in Plex Web App > Settings > Settings > Remote Access.  
Some results may not be accurate. This is determined by TMDB, not this app. However, false positives seem very rare.
